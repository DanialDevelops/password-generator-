## A password generator I built using javascript

In this project I worked on making a password generator using javascript that will create any password for you following required criteria, such as length, whether to include upper case or lower case, and special characters.

### Things I worked on
-worked on creating a function to generate a password

-worked with append tags to put my error messages on the page 

-worked with for and while loops

-worked with prompts and confirms
